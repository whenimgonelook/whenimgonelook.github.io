<h2 style="font-size: 1rem;">Collection 1</h2>
<p style="font-size: 0.8rem;">
    Silhouettes of my life is a printed portrayal of thoughts, meditations, and walks. I’ve always wanted to illustrate certain expres-
    sions on fabric, and over the years, there’s been a lot of experimentation and research on what I want to express. The first col-
    lection of 78! whenimgonelookformeinthesouth symbolizes a sentiment of lost patience and a devotion of commitment to completion. The
    result is a product that is visioned and mulled yet open-minded to be flexible. I believe that thoughts and actions specifically
    only happen when it is now. I desire to record and organize these actions and thoughts that I can only fully emphasize at 20.
    For me to look back on my life and see my forms of life exhibited in different mediums, all I try to do is one day connect my
    far distant future self to myself right now.

<h1 style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Methods</h1>
<p style="font-size: 0.8rem;">
    I created these T-shirts and hoodies with acrylic paint, dye-na-flow (fabric paint), and tracing paper. I would paint the design
    on blank paper with a mixed solution of acrylic paint and dye-na-flow. The solution must be thick enough to hold enough paint and
    texture when the tracing paper is applied and transferred to either the T-shirt or hoodie. The uneven paint layers create an in-
    teresting and organic print on the tracing paper, and when applied to the fabric, it makes more of this organic, distinctive
    look. When washed, the bold colors of the paint become subtle, gentle versions of what they were. This effect gives a nuance of
    vintage and minimalism. This is the distinctive look and method of 78! whenimgonelookformeinthesouth.
